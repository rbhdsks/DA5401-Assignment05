## ðŸš© Problem Statement

This assignment explores the challenges of **multi-label classification** in real-world machine learning by using advanced **non-linear dimensionality reduction** techniques like **t-SNE** and **Isomap**.

We will visually analyze the **Yeast dataset** to identify data veracity issues such as:

- Noisy/ambiguous labels  
- Outliers  
- Hard-to-learn data points  

This helps in understanding the difficulties a classifier would face with such complex and imbalanced datasets.
